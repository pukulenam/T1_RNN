["June 14, 2022 – Tampons may be harder to find due to supply chain challenges and inflation hikes that are causing higher prices.Social media users have posted about bare shelves and higher costs for months, marking the latest products to face stress under global supply chain concerns after baby formula, cars, and appliances.Other menstrual products have increased in price as well due to inflation, according to Bloomberg News. The average price for a package of menstrual pads has increased about 8% this year, and the price of a box of tampons has increased about 10%.Andre Schulten, the chief financial officer for Procter &amp; Gamble, which makes and sells 4.5 billion boxes of Tampax each year, said on a recent earnings call that it has been “costly and highly volatile” to acquire the raw materials needed for production.Raw materials such as cotton, rayon, and plastic, for instance, have been used to produce personal protective gear during the pandemic, which has led to shortages. The cost of transportation for consumer goods has also nearly tripled, and pandemic policies at ports have led to shipping delays.Edgewell Personal Care, which makes the brands Playtex and o.b., has had a severe staff shortage at its Delaware facility where tampons are made, according to Time. The FDA has classified tampons as Class II medical devices, which require certain quality control regulations and qualified workers on the assembly line, the news outlet reported.Representatives for CVS and Walgreens confirmed that they’ve had shortages in recent weeks, according to The Washington Post. Procter &amp; Gamble said it is working with retail partners to make feminine care products more available.“We understand it is frustrating for consumers when they can’t find what they need,” the company told the newspaper. “We can assure you this is a temporary situation.”Kimberly-Clark, which makes U by Kotex tampons, told the Post that it “has not experienced a product or supply shortage” in the U.S., saying it is “working closely with our retail partners to keep shelves stocked.”"]
