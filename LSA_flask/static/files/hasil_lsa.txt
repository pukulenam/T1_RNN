There's been a huge amount of work over the past few weeks to get the car ready. While we've been busy getting the car ready, the Northern Cape government has been doing some terrific work to get the desert fully race ready.       
When we arrive out in South Africa, we'll have to get the car ready to run on the desert. Every single run will have a detailed schedule, known as the "run profile", with a target speed and a list of test objectives. Each run will have a long list of test objectives. For the first test run, we'll start with phase 1, a static engine test, to check engine start-up procedure, check for leaks and check the onboard systems. After that, phase 2 will be the first rolling test. Finally, when we get to South Africa, I'll get to wear the new "Bloodhound LSR" race helmet for the first time.
